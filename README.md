# What?

This is a Firefox extension that plays YouTube Shorts videos in the normal player.

# Why?

The YouTube Shorts player is confusing and disturbing.

* It repeats the video.
* Instead of reducing the volume, the down arrow loads a random video, likely even louder.
* Comments are displayed in a stupid popup window.
* Vertical aspect ratio.

No.

# How?

It replaces `/shorts/` with `/watch?v=` in the URL, so you no longer have to do that manually.
